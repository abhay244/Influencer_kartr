# Influencer_kartr Setup Guide

This repository contains a script to clone and set up the [Influencer_kartr](https://github.com/Shadowmage-commits/Influencer_kartr.git) project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, make sure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Appropriate package manager (npm, yarn, pip, composer, etc. depending on the project)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the `setup.sh` script
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## What the Script Does

The `setup.sh` script performs the following actions:
1. Clones the Influencer_kartr repository
2. Detects the type of project (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
3. Installs the required dependencies using the appropriate package manager
4. Provides guidance on additional setup steps, if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

1. **Git Clone Fails**: Verify your internet connection and that the repository URL is correct
2. **Dependency Installation Fails**: Ensure you have the correct package manager installed and up-to-date
3. **Permission Issues**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to write to the target directory

## After Setup

Once the setup is complete, refer to the project's own documentation (README.md or similar) for instructions on how to run the application.
