you've probably seen a bunch of these videos but   I am going to give you a step by step on exactly 
what to do as soon as you arrive you walk in and   it's like the volume on life gets turned up to 
11 you hear it before you see it vendors shouting   deals being made tourists and locals jostling for 
space the air is thick with the smell of grilled   meat ripe fruit and just a hint of the sea this 
place is a mad house but it's the kind of chaos   that makes you feel alive every corner every 
stall has a story families that have been here   for Generations working their asses off to keep 
their Traditions alive there's Carmen who probably   knows more about olives than most of us know about 
our own lives or the grous brothers one of the few   vendors in the whole Market who carry oi in a can 
a rare delicacy that's as much part of their story   as it is their inventory then there's Shere always 
quick with a smile or Victor and his daughters at   Victor pakita our first stop today my favorite 
ibero place thank you so much you shave us off   some ibero you can find Iberico everywhere in this 
market but there's a reason I keep coming back to   Victor's stand she's the daughter and she's the 
friend no she's my cousin cousin oh there you   go B this guy's been slicing ham since he was a 
teenager and he's taught his daughter everything   she knows like look how glossy that is and fatty 
not just any ham 100% pure eoas dud look at that   shine right there which means these pigs aren't 
factory farm oh my God they're out there roaming   Oak Foresters eating Fallen acorns that's what 
gives the ham its nutty flavor and that marbling   that makes you weaken the need I mean that is just 
this isn't just food it's a connection to the land   to a tradition that's as Spanish as it gets it's 
also a luxury let's be honest this ham isn't for   everyone it's a reminder of what good food really 
cost look at that dude time effort patience and   yeah of course money but when you taste it you get 
why it's a big deal heaven in a cone it's not just   something you eat it's something you experience 
and for a lot of people here it's A Taste of Home   a family of a Spain that's disappearing so now 
you take this and you walk around boaria Market   little cone of a better CL labaria has been around 
in one form or another since the 13th century back   then it was just a few stalls Farmers from out of 
town selling whatever they could grow or catch now   it's a maze of over 200 vendors selling everything 
from fresh seafood to Candy to eggs and of course   oysters man you good okay so there's that Corner 
Spot over there that's always packed with a huge   line when you come over here there's nobody 
here and this man is the boss these aren your   typical oysters they're gal oysters firm creamy 
perfect look at this look at this freaking oyster holy before the 20th century shellfish was seen 
as peasant food sheep plentiful and a Lifeline for   those scraping by along the northern coast super 
Briny but like subtle as well a fantastic oyster   from Spain but things have changed today they're 
a symbol of glacier's Rich culinary tradition a   point of Pride and there's no place where that 
transformation is is more obvious than right   here in this market locals tourists it doesn't 
matter they all Belly Up For 6y Old plates of   these once humble oysters this is the coolest 
part about eating oysters in badia Market all   the stands have little tables like this and 
you just hang out in the middle of oyster fish   market and slurp them up it's the perfect start 
to what's coming next there's a bunch of little   bites you can grab throughout the entire Market 
but I usually go right to bararia for AA and some   razor clams this bar is the Market's version 
of shears and ask for share you sit shoulder   toosh shoulder with strangers who by the end of 
your meal somehow feel like Old Friends eight my   favorite thing on the menu you asked the razor 
clams I always order a little extra some for my   wife wife who pretends she doesn't eat as much as 
she actually does it does not get better than that   and some to share because that's the magic of this 
place you have to try that it's fantastic usually   I come to markets like this to rub elbows with 
locals to get a feel for the real pulse of a place   but there's a beauty to meeting people from all 
over the world too foreigners who aren't afraid   to dive head first into something new to savor a 
flavor they never tasted to become a little more   Spanish only for an afternoon byee graas all right 
now time to the Practical things we got to grab   some food and take it home meet the brothers grous 
in this in this place there my go-to for Tin Fish   in labaria if you guys want to find sea urchin 
in a can this is the spot I one time I bought   10 from These Guys these two were raised here go 
to school uh Saturday holiday work here Saturday   playing in the aisles as children while their 
parents and grandparents worked in the Stalls 1867 this was their playground and today it's 
their livelihood their home away from home that   is literally the beauty of Spain in two guys two 
brothers running a shop that's five generations   old their parents the parents of their great 
grandmother 1867 and I'm buying Sea urgin from   them the owner of the next shop grew up here too 
all right the last stop is to go to my Olive lady   her name is Carmen she has literally the best 
olives I've ever tasted in Spain that's a big   freaking statement this doll has been in their 
family for Generations oh like G now with her   husband by her side she's keeping that Legacy 
[Music] alive took over when you were 20 19   they've seen the years go by the market change 
but every time I'm here there she is the same   welcoming smile always pushing a little bowl of 
Olives at me this is my favorite you've got to try   these it's like she's found something new every 
time something worth sharing her Creations have   become legendary in the market which one's your 
favorite which one's your favorite I my favorite   of the Y is nam after Rita Hayworth's character in 
the 1946 film of the same name the perfect anel be   wrap around with the pepper in the middle I mean 
does it get better than this Carmen was one of   the first people I met when I came to Barcelona 
meeting her opened my eyes to the history the   love the passion that pulses through these walls 
and so every time I come to the market I make it   a point to meet someone new today it's the family 
behind Mama Juice Mama Juice his grandma started   out selling plantains on the street in 1944 she 
was able to get a tiny stand here in the market   and today just look at how much they've grown wow 
look at this each stall has its own story its own   struggles and triumphs and when you take time 
to walk to the vendors to really listen you get   pulled into that world wow in that moment you're 
not a visitor your family nice to meet you so when   you come to labaria don't just wander the aisles 
with your camera out get to know the people here   their stories their traditions because in a place 
like this it's not just about what's on the plate   it's about the hands that made it the lives behind 
it I promise you that's where the real magic is   and that's how you spend the perfect day in badia

https://youtu.be/figrl0aOULs?si=hDUzmPuO8UYusp-l,"Every single time someone watches this video, it helps feed someone in need. And since we get a lot of views, I brought a lot of people! Here you go. Thank you, friend. Yeah, no problem. If you're wondering how this works, every time someone watches this whole video, including you right now, money is generated. And as this video grows, that increasing amount of money will feed an astonishing amount of people. Everybody eats. But that's not all it's going to do. Mr. Beast! You watching this video will supply farmland, build massive kitchens, fill schools with food for their students, and save children from child labor. So, honestly, I'm glad you're here. There you go. 1500 people have now been fed. I'm very excited for the future. And because of our meal program, the school attendance skyrocketed, so it only made sense to upgrade their classrooms. They have so few desks at the school that some students literally have to sit on rocks. I assume you're not supposed to put four kids on one of these. Of course. This is only supposed to take two kids. - Really? - Not four. Can you ask them if they'd like new desks? [speaking foreign language] Yes! I'll be right back, then. Bring it on in! We got some new desks for everybody! And now, even with all these new students, everyone has a place to sit. Look how happy they are! Let’s get to unloadin'! Bro, I love this video! This really puts into perspective... the things we take for granted in America and Europe. Like, something as simple as a new desk for their school so they don't have to sit on rocks... is literally making their week. - Thank you, Jimmy. - No problem. This means a lot to me. All right, thanks for the help, guys. They're carryin' all the way right now. You ready for your new desks? Yeah! Yeah? Obviously, they can't feed all these kids breakfast and lunch every school day with... this “kitchen"". Which is why we built this brand new kitchen! And on top of revampin' the school, we also dug a well here with water storage, plus a greenhouse and, pan the camera, a farm. We are hooking this school up with everything they need. And for the influx of students at neighboring schools, we're partnering with... Massive farms like this one! And this is Justice. He runs the farm. Welcome to Oleleshiva farm. We have two parts of the farm. One part of the farm goes directly to the schools, and the other part of the farm, we specifically grow to sell to nearby communities, which helps to keep the nonprofit going. And because right now these farms are using manual labor, which is not efficient enough to produce as much food as the schools need... ...we brought you a brand new tractor! No way! Now, instead of people doing manual work like this, they can instead just use this tractor. What previously took 45 minutes will now just take 45 seconds. This tractor is more important than you may realize. Just because we're takin' the money from all the views on this video and giving it to school meal programs, doesn't mean food just magically spawns outta thin air. The food has to come from somewhere, and in this case, it's comin' from the increased yield on this tractor across this massive farm. And to be sure this food reaches as many people as possible, we've got a special surprise for the school. Everyone, come over here! Here are the keys to your brand new truck for the community! Congratulations! What?! I want you to use this to feed all of the community. Thank you. Thank you so much! We have a new truck!! This truck will enable the school to provide excess meals to families all over the community. And inside of your guys's brand new truck is enough food for over 100,000 meals! The community was so thankful they...gifted me a goat. I have a goat now. And if you thought 100,000 meals was a lot, by the end of this video, because of your view, we will be giving away a million meals. That's Kenya for ya! Let's head to Ghana, where we also funded the construction of not just another kitchen and water tank, but also a new farm for a local school. The cabbage we're planting here, in around two and a half months, will look like this. We can feed the students just from this small cabbage farm. But unlike this farm, the millions of others all across Ghana don't share such a positive story. It’s a farming community. Most of the parents are cocoa farmers. And sadly, the children are as well, playing a crucial role in generating their family's income. Four out of five of your students, before they enrolled to this school, worked on a cacao farm. Yeah. And now, instead of working on a cocoa farm, they're getting an education just because we're giving them a free meal. Yeah. This food is increasing our enrollment. It will bring the kids to school and they'll stay in school, too. And... we found another way to help kids stay in school. These are their brand-new cows. We bought dozens of pairs of animals that we're gonna be gifting to these families, and with that extra income, they'll be able to send their kids to school as opposed to having them work on farms. Tomorrow will be their first day of school? Yes. Congrats! All right! And with so many animals to give away, I had to rely on Tareq for help, which... was a mistake. Tareq, bring out the next ten goats at the same time! Oh, man, that's a lotta goats. That's a lotta goats. Come on, goats! Come on, come on! Here we go. Wait! No, no no! Somebody get the goats! All right, Tareq! Tareq! They got away. Tareq, you're fired. Congrats on your brand-new goats!! And I know the perfect way to celebrate our time in Ghana. Have you guys had chocolate? Tell me what you guys think of it! No problem. Do you like the taste of it? Yes! Do you guys wanna see the drone? Yes. If you look up, you can see yourself on the camera! You are welcome, you are welcome, you are welcome, my friend. It's sad, but 45 percent of children that live in to cacao farming households in Ghana work in illegal child labor. So to fight this, at Feastables, we're working with the farmers to establish Child labor monitoring and remediation systems to get these kids out of child labor and into school. It's been our prayer that we have school feeding for our learners, and now we have it. So, we thank you so much, and we hope that this will continue for years. I hope forever. And now that these families in Ghana have enough to eat, back in the United States, ending hunger requires solving a completely different problem. Believe it or not, America produces so much food, that almost 40 percent of it simply gets thrown away. But if we can preserve just ten percent of it, we could theoretically end hunger in the United States. And that brings us to the Philadelphia Wholesale Produce market... One of the largest food marketplaces in America! Where every year, up to ten million pounds of unsold food is at risk of going to waste. Which is where Evan and his nonprofit, Sharing Excess, come in. And if they don't have a place to sell it, it's the easiest option to throw it away. Let's take these potatoes, for example. Some retailer might be like, ""Hey, if they're within one month of expiring, we don't want it."" But instead you're like, ""Yo! why not give it to people who are starving?"" That's right. It's a no-brainer. So Evan and his organization, Sharing Excess, collect millions of pounds of food that, for silly reasons, would have been thrown away. What are we lookin' for? This looks good. That looks good, so we're gonna put it in the good box. This one? This one looks a little... not good. Not so good. Throw it in the bin. Okay. And that's all you do? Yeah. If we make it more complicated, people wouldn't do it. Wait, Tareq, why is your pepper so small? I think I got the biggest pepper out of the boys! Everyone knows this is what you do with your pepper. Wait. Your pepper's deformed, Nolan. It's, like, curly. Yo, the boys wish they had a pepper this big. All this food is just what's been donated today from this building. And there's even more out there. We need more trucks to be able to pick up all of the food that's actually available. This market and others like it, have so much food that even Sharing Excess Organization can't distribute it all before it goes bad. But with just one more truck, they could rescue up to seven million pounds of additional food, every year. And maybe you can see where this is going, but I made sure Evan couldn't as I led him to the surprise that I had prepared for him. Evan, take off your blindfold and turn around! Look at your brand new truck!!! Yeah! And again, just by watching this video, you're helping us give more money to Sharing Excess so that they can continue to fill this new truck with food for years to come. But let me show you what just one day with an additional truck can do... starting with supplying the Double Trellis Food kitchen where they cook gourmet meals for the needy every day. Everything you see here would have been thrown away, but now it is a gourmet meal going to someone in need. This is crazy. And while the meals we cooked fed 600 people, our one truck still had thousands of pounds of fresh produce to stock multiple community fridges, hand out directly to people on the streets, and even host our own food drive in North Carolina, where hundreds of people were in need of nutritious food. And you can help too, with the help of DoorDash. By watching this video right now, you're helping feed someone in need. And for a limited time, if you purchase this hoodie, available exclusively at DashMarts on DoorDash, you're gonna help to donate... a hundred meals like this to people in need. I got some meals for ya. - Oh, I appreciate it. - Of course. I'm noticing Evan's putting his Sharing Excess branding over the... DoorDash hoodies. All right, here we go. Oh, there he is! Sorry, I had to pause the food drive to settle that. Do you need a hat? Scan the QR code or click the link in the description to purchase your hoodie on DoorDash now. Let's help as many people in need as possible. DoorDash's Project DASH, in just a few years has helped to deliver over a hundred million meals. All this food would have been thrown away. Isn't that crazy? That is crazy. Hey! Do you watch the videos? - Yeah. - Do you know his name? No. She took a picture of me! Hey, neither do we! And once the food drive was over, I still had two more surprises for Evan. Evan, I have two checks for you. First, to get us to a million meals, here's a check for six hundred thousand meals. Oh, my God... Before the video goes up, we said we'd do a million meals. I need you to do six hundred thousand of them. We're on it. And then after the video goes up... I don't know yet. It depends how many of them watch the video. So here's a blank check. And as they watch the video, I will fill it in so you can keep feeding people in need. Oh, my God. Guys, please watch this video. We could provide so much food! The dollar amount written here is up to you guys. And not only did DoorDash step up to help fund these meals, but so did a gentleman named Tony Robbins who has a message for you guys. What you're doing is so important. Every view you watch is gonna bring more meals, so I'm gonna commit ten million meals to you, matching funds for anybody who wants to join me here. Let's really do everything we can and get as many people helped as possible. Make sure you share this video with your friends. Because of Tony Robbins and DoorDash, every 20 views equals a meal to someone in need. Let's share this.","Video Info: {'video_id': 'figrl0aOULs', 'title': 'Watch This Video To Feed 1 Person In Need', 'channel_id': 'UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA', 'channel_title': 'MrBeast', 'subscriber_count': 386000000, 'view_count': 43994427, 'like_count': 3310796, 'comment_count': 63041, 'engagement_rate': 7.67, 'keywords': ['https', 'doordash', 'mrbeast', 'hoodie', 'meals', 'food', 'check', 'viewstats', 'will', 'facebook'], 'comment_sentiment': {'positive': 7.0, 'neutral': 92.0, 'negative': 1.0}, 'top_comments': [{'author': '@MrBeast', 'text': 'Share this video so we can feed more people!', 'likes': 79064, 'published_at': '2025-04-12T18:58:10Z'}, {'author': '@Zemal-hfsryhbjj', 'text': 'Where is the humanity when it comes to Palestine  😥', 'likes': 2, 'published_at': '2025-04-24T03:39:27Z'}, {'author': '@DeviKumariThapa-ht3dw', 'text': 'He proved that humanity is still in this world 🙏🏻❤️', 'likes': 1, 'published_at': '2025-04-24T04:32:05Z'}, {'author': '@FernandoAyarachi-v9x', 'text': 'Hola mrbeast mi madre tiene deudas quisiera que me hagas el favor de ayudarme mi madre se la pasa trabajando lejos de casa y yo en la mina jeje pero quisiera que me ayudaras a pagar esas deudas así mi madre se quita un peso más de encima porfavor soy de potosi Bolivia 🇧🇴🇧🇴🇧🇴🇧🇴🇧🇴🇧🇴🇧🇴🇧🇴🇧🇴🇧🇴', 'likes': 1, 'published_at': '2025-04-24T04:24:40Z'}, {'author': '@MdSiam9070-i8u', 'text': 'বাংলাদেশের 🎉🎉🎉', 'likes': 1, 'published_at': '2025-04-24T03:52:05Z'}], 'potential_sponsors': ['Sharing Excess', 'Youtuber'], 'influencer_info': {'name': 'MrBeast', 'subscribers': 386000000, 'total_videos': 863, 'total_views': 80212952492}} Extracted from YouTube API",2025-04-24 05:17:21
